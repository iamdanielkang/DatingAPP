  <!-- When we are looping over content in angular, we can use
       structural directives. They are something that modifies 
       the DOM in our HTML in some way. LI's don't exist without
       users, so, they don't form part of the DOM until this is
       executed. -->

    <li *ngFor='let user of users'>{{user.id}} - {{user.userName}} </li>
