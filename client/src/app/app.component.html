<h1>{{title}}</h1>


<!-- When we are looping over content in angular, we can use
     structural directives. They are something that modifies 
     the DOM in our HTML in some way. LI's don't exist without
     users, so, they don't form part of the DOM until this is
     executed. -->
<ul>
  <li *ngFor='let user of users'>{{user.id}} - {{user.userName}} </li>
</ul>
